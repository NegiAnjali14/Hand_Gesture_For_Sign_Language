# Hand Gesture Sign Language Recognition

## 📌 Project Description

Hand Gesture Sign Language Recognition is a computer vision project that detects and recognizes hand gestures using a webcam. The system uses **Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Machine Learning** to identify hand landmarks and classify gestures in real time.

This project helps demonstrate how computer vision can assist in communication with people who use sign language.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

* Python 3.8 or above
* Webcam
* Windows / Linux / macOS

Install required libraries:

pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy

## 📸 Dataset Collection

The dataset for training the model is collected using the **datacollection.py** script.
This script captures images from the webcam and stores them inside the **Data** folder according to gesture categories.

Example gesture classes:

* Hello
* I Love You
* No
* Ok
* Please
* Thank You
* Yes
